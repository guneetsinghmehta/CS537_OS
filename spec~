1 Inputs
a. one or two inputs 
b. if one input then sorting on the basis of first word
c. sort on the basis of input word
d. format check - dash and followed by a number
if not then - print to stderr - Error: Bad command line parameters and exit with return code 1.

2 Hints
a. fopen - to open a file
b. fgets - reads each line 
fclose -closes the file
strcmp - to compare strings 
qsort - library routine
strtok - chops the lines into words - copy and then use on lines
exit(1) - to give error and exit(0) - to exit cleanly
malloc - to allocate memory
fstat/ stat - to find out file length

3. assumptions
a. return code on success==0
b. multiple spaces may separate words in lines
c. max line length =128
d. if a specific key does not exist on the line then use the last word
e.empty line - use an empty string to do sorting

4 Invalid files - if file is not open due to any readon-
 Error: Cannot open file foo with no extra spaces (if the file was named foo ) and then exit with return code 1.

5On any error code, you should print the error to the screen using fprintf() , and send the error message to stderr (standard error) and not stdout (standard output). This is accomplished in your C code as follows:

fprintf(stderr, “whatever the error message is\n”);

Steps
1. Done Check the qrguments and do error checking
2. open file and read the stats of the file Done
 
3. allocate memory for lines Done
4. allocate memory for words
5. find qsort for strings - or assign indices for the words and bubble sort and move the indices accordingly
6. malloc error handling
