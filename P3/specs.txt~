Specs for P3 - XV6
1. Adding  null pointer-
a. Zeroth page on the VM should be an invalid page (Zeroth page in xv6 is a valid pointer in xv6)
b. Set the zeroth page as invalid 

2 . structure of memory -
code - starts at VPN 0
stack -  page
heap - grows below

3. exec creates a new process - new Address space - n

4. loop in exec.c - change the sz and change in allocuvm

5. change in user/makefile.mk - change the USER_LDFLAGS -- section-start =and put the starting address there
4096 in hex

6. every thing else in the AS - like the memory out of code,stack and heap - will be invalid
so if we do not load anything to the first page then the first page will be invalid

kalloc - allocates physical memory 
memset - set the memory to 0 - usage memset(mem,0,PGSIZE);
mappages
